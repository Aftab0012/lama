## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Aftab0012/lama.git`

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

3. Configure Backend: Update the `config.js` file with the appropriate backend endpoint.

4. Start the development server: `npm start`

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- React Router: A library for routing and navigation in React applications.
- MongoDb
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Note:- Redux will only work if backend is not connected, The Redux was implemented to add static project data from state, So as of now this website is connected to backend but the Redux fucntionality is not implemented in react components, If you wanna use just use reacts dispatch() and useSelector() hooks to make it useable .

## Available Scripts

In the Project directory lama do `cd backend` and youll go to `BACKEND` folder and run following script to start the backend:-

### `npm start`

In the project directory `lama`, you can run following command to start frontend:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Under Development

The following features are currently under development and will be added later:
